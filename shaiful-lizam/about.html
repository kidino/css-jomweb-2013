                    <p>If you ask me, life is all about who you know and what
                    you can find. When you live up in the Riftshadow Ruins,
                    just finding food can be tough. So you need to cut corners,
                    you need to scrounge, you need to know your strengths.</p>

                    <p>Some of the beasts up there can kill you, so you need a
                    way to trap the weak and duck the strong. On the upside,
                    the ruins have history, and history is worth a lot to some
                    people. There used to be a palace there, where they had all
                    these dark rituals. Bad stuff.</p>

                    <p>If you survived the ceremony, they would shatter a
                    crystal and split your soul into pieces. They made great
                    art though! Sculptures and such. Let me tell you: sometimes
                    you stumble onto some of those old carvings. Take a pack
                    full of those to town and sell them, then get yourself food
                    for a few weeks. If luck is really on your side, you might
                    find a Riftshadow crystal. Get it appraised and start
                    asking around.</p>

                    <p>Someone always knows some crazy fool looking for this
                    kind of thing. If all else fails, sell it to a Magus the
                    next time one's in town. They love that stuff. Still,
                    whatever you do, be careful handling those crystals. You do
                    not want one to go off on you. It really hurts.</p>
